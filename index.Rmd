# Boulder BrainTrust<sup>TM</sup> graphics and Data Wrangling

We have developed an R cookbook to make the process of creating publication-ready graphics in our in-house style using R's ggplot2 library a more reproducible process, as well as making it easier for people new to R to create graphics. This was inspired by the [BBC's cookbook](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/). 

In addition to creating graphics, this cookbook also includes two sections on data wrangling. One is specific to working with RiverWare output in the form of rdf files, and the other is more generic. The idea here is to document wrangling problems we've solved, to make it easier to solve the next time.

**Let's get the admin out of the way first...**

## Load all the libraries you need

A few of the steps in this cookbook - and to create charts in R in general - require certain packages to be installed and loaded. If these packages are not installed, you will need to install them first. Except for CRSSIO, all packages are available on CRAN. CRSSIO can be installed with `devtools::install_github("BoulderCodeHub/CRSSIO")`.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RWDataPlyr)
library(scales)
library(devtools)
library(CRSSIO) # install with devtools::install_github("BoulderCodeHub/CRSSIO")
```


# Data Wrangling

# rdf Wrangling

## RWDataPlyr

### Overview

RWDataPlyr is a tool to read and manipulate data generated from [RiverWare<sup>TM</sup>](http://www.riverware.org) simulations in rdf, csv, and nc formats and work with those data in a dplyr pipeline. It provides functions to gather,  aggregate, and summarize data from multiple RiverWare simulations, i.e., scenarios.

### Installation

RWDataPlyr can be installed from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("RWDataPlyr")
```

Or the development version can be installed from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BoulderCodeHub/RWDataPlyr")
```

### How does RWDataPlyr work?

RWDataPlyr provides at least three workflows for reading and using RiverWare data:

1. Reading and manipulating a single scenario
    * Fast
    * Best for inspecting a single slot
    * If comparing scenarios, must manually repeat for each scenario
    * Relies on `read_rdf()` and `read_rw_csv()`
2. Summarizing multiple slots of data from a single scenario
    * Repeatable; allows user to process many slots at once
    * Best for producing "polished" analyses of a single scenario
    * Relies on `rdf_aggregate()` and user specified `rwd_agg` object
3. Aggregating and summarizing many scenarios
    * Repeatable; allows user to process many slots for many scenarios at once
    * Repeats summary of a single scenario on multiple scenarios and combines results together
    * Relies on `rw_scen_aggregate()` and user specified `rwd_agg` object

Check out the workflow vignette for more details:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("rwdataplyr-workflow", package = "RWDataPlyr")
```


The code below shows how data from `rw_scen_aggregate()` and user specified `rwd_agg` can be used within standard chart-production workflow. In this is example monthly data from the `RWDataPlyr` package has already been aggregated to an annual EOCY value. The example creates a boxplot of the EOCY values to compare two scenarios.   

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Load required scripts to create the custom plot types 
source('code/Stat_emp_ExcCrv.r')

#Data for chart from RWDataPlyr package
scen_res <- RWDataPlyr::scen_data

#Specify variables for chart and data minipulation
variable <- "peEocy"
y_lab <- "EOCY Pool Elevation (ft)"
title <- "EOCY Pool Elevation (ft)"
startyr <- 2018
endyr <- 2022
caption <- "Note: The boxplots show the distribution of traces, one for each year. The boxplot boxes correspond to the 25th and 75th quantiles,\nthe whiskers enclose the 10th to 90th quantiles,with points representing data that falls outside this range."

#minipulate data 
df <- scen_res %>%
  dplyr::filter(Variable == variable) %>%
  dplyr::filter(startyr <= Year && Year <= endyr) %>% #filter year
  dplyr::group_by(Scenario, Year) 

#plot data 
p <- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Year), y = Value, color = Scenario)) +
  CRSSIO::stat_boxplot_custom(qs = c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)) +
  labs(title = paste(variable,startyr,"-",endyr),
       y = y_lab, x = "Year", caption = caption) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) #left justify

#print graph 
print(p)
```


# Plotting

## How to use the RW-RDF-Process-Plot Scripts 

### Generate rdf Files from RiverWare
1. Use RiverWare MRM to generate rdf Files from MTOM or CRSS
1. Option A: Move files for the current run to ./scenarios/currentrun folder. Move old rdf files into ../scenarios/previousrun folder 
1. Option B: Later modify code to point scen_dir at the location of your scenarios 

### Setup RW-RDF-Process-Plot

#### If you've previously cloned RW-RDF-Process-Plot
1. Open the repository in git extensions 
1. Start up the Git Bash control line
1. Enter 
`$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/usbr/RW-RDF-Process-Plot.git` 

#### If you have a previous packrat library you want to move into this repository
Moving previous packrat library (from MTOM directory or other)
1. Clone the package to your local area where you have write access
1. Move your packrat file from your MTOM folder to this location a. Don't overwrite any existing files in this repo
1. Run `packrat::init()` to init packrat.
1. In the lower right window verify Packages lists a Packrat Library with all files having descriptions

#### If its your first time using the processing scripts and/or R in general
Follow the instructions in the 2.Using R for post processing MTOM results wiki

Your set to run!
See _3. Using the Code_ wiki

#### If its your first time using the MTOM R process script and/or R in general
Ensure the following are installed:
* [R (3.4.4)](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [R tools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/)
    * R tools must be added to the Path environment variable. This is an option while installing R tools, so as long as it is performed during the install, no additional steps are necessary.
* [RStudio desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

**First time Running R (or after installing a new version)**

The first time you use R, or when upgrading to a new releases (e.g., 3.4.x to 3.5.x), it will take some time (~20 minutes) to install all of the necessary R packages. After the first time, it will be much quicker. 

1. Double-click MTOM.Rproj to launch the R-Studio project. You should get the following message:
    ![Packrat bootstrap message](https://i.imgur.com/DqcL4Bh.png)
1. Install all necessary packages, using either method a, or b.

    a. Type `packrat::restore()` in the R-console and hit enter

    b. Use the R-studio GUI options *this does not seem to be available in all versions of RStudio)

    * Navigate to the Packages tab (in the lower right pane of RStudio)

    * If the down carrot (see picture) is available, click it, then click "Check Library Status". If it's not available, use method **a)** to install the packages. 

    ![Packrat RStudio options](https://i.imgur.com/wlRZKRy.png)

    * You should receive a message that many of the packages need updating. Click "Restore"

1. If you receive any errors, **close RStudio, reopen it**, and then type `packrat::restore()` in the R console and press enter to continue the installation.

1. **Close RStudio, and Reopen it.**

### Master Model Scripts 
These are the master scripts which take user input then call the process and plot functions. 
1. open _code/[MODEL XXXX]_Process&Plot_Generics.R _ 
1. update scen_dir and results_dir in **1. Set Up** if scenarios aren't listed location or you want a custom results location 
1. update the variables in **2.UserInput** section
1. Optional: save the changes as a custom name (don't push these unless its a standard analysis for the team)
1. Ctrl + Alt + R to run the code and create the figures in your results_dir 

### Process Function
This function processes annual, monthly or daily output from CRSS & MTOM for reservoir Inflow, Outflow ("flow") or Pool Elevation ("pe").

### Generic Plot Functions
These functions are called by the master scripts after Generic_Scen_Process() returns scen_res. The functions can process designed for reservoir Inflow, Outflow ("flow") or Pool Elevation ("pe"). The functions allow users to pick one of 3 figure types (1) Trace Mean, (2) Boxpolt of all Traces, (3) is Exceedance. 

#### Generic Annual Plot  
Annual period of Calendar Year ("cy") or Water Year ("wy") must be specified. Plotting varies based on if the slot is a "flow", monthly values are summed over the annual period, or if a "pe", value for the end of the annual period (CY = Dec, WY = Sept) is used.   

#### Generic Annual Plot  
Data is plotted "asis." If plotting (3) Exceedance you must specify a exc_month of 1-12 (1 - Jan, 12 - Dec). 

#### Generic Daily Plot  
Data processing is not available via RWDataPlyr functions so output from daily slots is handled differently than the above. It is not recommended that you use this script to look at more than one year of data so the script defaults to taking only the year listed as startyr. When plotting (1) Trace Mean is all the daily means as individual data points but NOTE: the months appear to start in Feb since first CRSS timestep is Jan 31. For (2) Boxpolt of all Traces the boxplots show the distribution of daily flow grouped by month. (3) Exceedance is the CDF for all daily flows.
